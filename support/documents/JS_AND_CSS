Execute the "../tools/rebuild_styles_and_scripts" tool from the main folder to regenerate compressed 
and concatenated script files. The tool builds one script file for general pages (blog articles, archive views...) and one for gallery pages.

In your settings file, you can use the "DEBUG_JS" or "DEBUG_CSS" flag to get individual, uncompressed js-files instead of the compressed archives. This helps to quickly test changes and to fix bugs.
