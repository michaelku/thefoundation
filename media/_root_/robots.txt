# Welcome Robots!
# We hope you have come to visit us in peace and goodwill!
#
# Please keep in mind that:
# - A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
# - A robot must obey orders given to it by human beings (especially using the robots.txt),
#   except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
# - A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the 
#   First or Second Law.

# Gort! Klaatu barada nikto!
